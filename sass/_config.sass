@import 'bourbon/bourbon'

// Background color of the whole widget
$bg: #181817

// Background color of the button backing area. As you can see on the mock, 
// this is actually a gradient, so this variable sets the top color and you'll 
// need to use SASS to ensure it's rendered as a radial gradient, using the 
// color functions to choose a dirtier color for the shadow (as shown in the mock)
//$control-bg: 

// Background color of the button. Again, this is actually a gradient and will need 
// SASS functions to make it shaded on top.
//$button-bg: 

// Background color when hovered. (Again, modified to gradient via SASS functions).
//$button-hover-bg: 

// Background color when active.  (Again, modified to gradient via SASS functions).
//$button-active-bg: 

// Color of the button symbol (play button, pause button etc)
//$button-fg: 

// Color of progress bar on played portion and also text below it. As shown in the 
// mock, the bar is two colors, so this is the top color and need to use SASS to 
// darken the bottom color.
//$progress-fg: 

// Color of progress bar on unplayed portion.
//$progress-bg: 

// Color of progress bar when buffering. You can use something like Twitter 
// Bootstrap's progress indicator trick, using masks to make this declarable in CSS.
//$progress-buffering: 

// Color of volume and symbols. (Note this doesn't have two colors, unlike progress 
// bar. It just extends out from the left.)
//$volume-bg: 

// Color of episode items.
$episode-bg: #101114

// Color of episode text.
$episode-fg: #FFFFFF

// Color of episode option text
$episode-option: #CCCCCC

// bg current playing
$episode-active: #3A3938

// bg when hover
$episode-hover: #252323

// Other variables:
// (true or false) Whether to include the thumbnail image above the player.
$thumbnail: true

// Player width. Empty by default, so width will automatically be 100% (ie the 
// full-width of the parent element). To support fluid layout, you will need to set 
// button widths based on percent-values.
$width: 480px

// If set, overrides the default font and is used as a font-family style for the 
// whole widget. For the default font, you should use a font from Google Web Fonts 
// which matches the mock as closely as possible. 
$font-family: 'Abel', 'Ubuntu Mono', sans-serif
